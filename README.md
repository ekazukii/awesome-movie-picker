# Awesome Movie Picker

Choose a movie to watch tonight based on the streaming platforms you have, the type of movie you want to watch and the length of the movie. You can also check which movies are popular at the moment to go see at the cinema

Check the [website here](https://amp.ekazuki.fr)
There is also a mobile app written with flutter, you can check it [here](https://github.com/ekazukii/movie-picker-flutter)

Currently the website supports only english and french movie search but I will try to add more languages soon.

You can also clone the project locally

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ekazukii/awesome-movie-picker.git
cd awesome-movie-picker
npm install
npm run dev
```

This project was created to learn more about the new version of NuxtJS (3.0), and about mobile programming using flutter.
